# Luke's Media Downloader

## USAGE
I recommend running this in tmux so you can detach the session
```bash
$ tmux
$ python app.py
```
tmux detach: `Ctrl+b d`
tmux attach: `tmux a`
<em>This lets you see the console output from the program if something went wrong</em>

## Notes
This runs a simple url input page on port 5000 at the IP of the device running the script (e.g., 192.168.1.134:5000)
